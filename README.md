This shell gives you **structure without confusion**: Overview → Quick Start → Getting Started → Outputs → Tests → Roadmap → License. Tomorrow, once you’ve coded and run the queries, we’ll fill in the outputs and make it recruiter‑ready.

👉 Would you like me to also sketch a **matching ERD diagram prompt** now, so you’ll have a placeholder image ready to drop into `docs/` when we polish the README?
